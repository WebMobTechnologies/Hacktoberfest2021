# Adopting Agile and DevOps 

In today digital economy, strategic software development is the key to drive innovation and boost competitive advantage.

As more companies are trying to remain ahead of the competition, it is becoming essential that they implement Agile and DevOps methodologies to thrive. Agile and DevOps will bring them an array of benefits that will only boost their potential.

## Agile and DevOps

First of all, we have asked them to define Agile and DevOps and tell us why do they think these are two essential methodologies for businesses.

Agile and Technology Transition Leader and CTO of Prima Recon, starts by defining Agile as a mindset, a methodology, and a modernized way of doing the work necessary to create successful products and services in an incremental, exploratory way by quickly hitting the market with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and using the feedback to adapt and re-align to the changing market trends and customer needs and repeat the process through the lifetime of the product.

### Agile is necessary :-

- Recognizes a primary and important role for the teams and the people involved in producing services and products, higher than processes and tools that are used.

- Invests the bulk of energy and efforts on providing functioning and useful products and services, instead of trying to create and maintain comprehensive documentation of the work (which would have to go through changes when we adjust and re-align our effort at the end of each iteration).

- Gives higher value to customer collaboration throughout the entire incremental product (and service) creation and improvement (via short feedback cycles), way above and higher than trying to lock-in customers in ironclad contracts.

- Puts the high focus on the teamâ€™s ability to quickly respond to changes (in customer needs or preferences and market trends), instead of forcing them to follow a pre-cast plan (thus taking away their flexibility to adapt and re-align quickly).
