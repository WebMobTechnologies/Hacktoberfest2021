# Adopting Agile and DevOps 

In today digital economy, strategic software development is the key to drive innovation and boost competitive advantage.

As more companies are trying to remain ahead of the competition, it is becoming essential that they implement Agile and DevOps methodologies to thrive. Agile and DevOps will bring them an array of benefits that will only boost their potential.

## Agile and DevOps

First of all, we have asked them to define Agile and DevOps and tell us why do they think these are two essential methodologies for businesses.

Agile and Technology Transition Leader and CTO of Prima Recon, starts by defining Agile as a mindset, a methodology, and a modernized way of doing the work necessary to create successful products and services in an incremental, exploratory way by quickly hitting the market with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and using the feedback to adapt and re-align to the changing market trends and customer needs and repeat the process through the lifetime of the product.

### Agile is necessary :-

- Recognizes a primary and important role for the teams and the people involved in producing services and products, higher than processes and tools that are used.

- Invests the bulk of energy and efforts on providing functioning and useful products and services, instead of trying to create and maintain comprehensive documentation of the work (which would have to go through changes when we adjust and re-align our effort at the end of each iteration).

- Gives higher value to customer collaboration throughout the entire incremental product (and service) creation and improvement (via short feedback cycles), way above and higher than trying to lock-in customers in ironclad contracts.

- Puts the high focus on the team’s ability to quickly respond to changes (in customer needs or preferences and market trends), instead of forcing them to follow a pre-cast plan (thus taking away their flexibility to adapt and re-align quickly).

## The future of agile and DevOps

It is expected that the DevOps market adoption will rise beyond $12.85 billion by 2025.

With rapidly changing business dynamics and customer expectations, digital transformation is the only way to stay profitable and grow for any organization, he says.

'Agile and DevOps are playing at the core of this process.’

'We will witness a continued growth in adoption of Agile and DevOps as the platform for systems thinking, to drive strategic investments based on their target business outcomes.’

Indeed, he continues, as more companies adopt Agile,  he expects that large frameworks like the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) will continue to change in response. For Neil, these methodologies will move from the software development part of a business to other parts of the business, driving overall business agility.

## The benefits...

At the beginning of their agile transformation, many enterprises will struggle because they are attached to their infrastructure and processes. However, there are many advantages that come with using both Agile and DevOps methodologies within a business.

1.  **Shorter value delivery cycle**s: As a joint benefit of Agile and DevOps, you can establish a faster and more efficient product and service creation and delivery process faster and more efficiently.

2. **A stronger culture of collaboration across business and technology:** Agile – specifically Scaled Agile – breaks down departmental silos and re-groups the teams around the Value Streams. This allows the business and technology teams to collaborate and communicate in a dynamic and continuous environment. DevOps helps with improving business agility by integration across teams in the organization. This way all team members (business and technology), become owners of quality and timeliness of deliverables.

3. **Improved Customer Journeys:**  DevOps can help organizations raise their deployment frequency by 200 times and reduce their recovery times by 24 times, which puts them in a strong competitive position in the market compared to other organizations. The DevOps automated CI/CD pipeline significantly raises predictability, reliability, and stability of the products, which in turn raises the quality of customer experience using them and leads to an upward shift in customer sentiment towards the business conducted by the organization.

4. **Promoting a Culture of Innovation:** Agile and DevOps establish an enterprise-wide, fast-moving, adaptive, and incrementally evolving environment that can serve as a breeding ground of new ideas through the ease of experimenting with innovations in the market through Minimum Viable Proofs and Products and collection of feedback on customer reactions.

## ...and the challenges

Leveraging Agile and DevOps in digital transformation brings a corporate-wide cultural change, which can raise resistance at many levels.

As we mentioned before, Development is designed to seek innovation and disruption while Ops wants stability and lack of change. Merging them into DevOps means having Dev innovate with plans on how to have a stable product that can be maintained, and have Ops stabilize the platform but maintain the needed Agility to change into a new stable model when needed.

Then, he continues, you need to scan through our existing infrastructure and application platforms to find legacy systems that have built up a significant technical debt for the organization over the years and will pose as a hurdle to the digital transformation plan. After this, you need to decide on what to keep and maintain and what to retire, and what to build fresh using API and Micro-Services.

Once we have the Agile teams using DevOps and have established a roadmap on how to shift our existing platforms to flexible digital solutions, Arman says, we can incrementally move forward through the transformation. We should plan to have a moment of pause and looking back at the end of each iteration, to inspect and adapt our effort for the next iteration with the needed re-alignment and corrective action items.

Moreover, Neil states that Agile (and DevOps) are more than adopting a set of ceremonies and doing a re-org. Indeed, many companies have made an investment in agile through training and restructuring and have not seen the benefit, since they have not committed to changing their culture.

## Implementing Agile and DevOps

‘You only need to implement Agile and DevOps for the businesses you want to keep!’

The rising market turbulence and the threatening aggregate power of new disruptors swarming the market, all equipped with Agile framework and DevOps pipelines have made the combined power of these two frameworks a vital factor in the survival and growth of any organization in today’s world.

Hence, the competitive advantage of Agile and DevOps teams in responding to changing customer needs and market trends, while maintaining high-quality product delivery, is the best reason for any business to go through the necessary changes to establish and incorporate them into their digital transformation.

If an enterprise wants to stay relevant in the market in the face of the rising power of rivals and shifting tides, there is no other available solution as effective as the integrated power of Agile and DevOps in maintaining their position in the market and help them grow with the flow of trends.
